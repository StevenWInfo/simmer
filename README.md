# Rough

## TODO

- Figure out a lot of stuff.
- Not even considering imports yet.
- Probably need some sort of monad for evaluation with the environment (state monad?)
- If conditional can just be shorthand/sugar for a function that takes pairs of functions that are called without parameters, the first being something that returns a boolean to see if the second is evaluated.
- Should make documentation for implementers of the language in other host languages.
